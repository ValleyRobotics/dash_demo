# Dash Demo Project, using Lending Club Data

## This project was created to demonstrate the value of deversifing a portfolio instead of just purchasing one loan.  The dashboard runs a monti carlo simulation based on the Lending Club Data to show portfolio returns.  By selecting a small amount of loans and running multiple times, you can see the variation in returns as opposed to running numerous loans thousands of times.
